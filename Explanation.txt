Given an equation, represented by "words" on left side and the "target" on right side.
You need to check if the equation is solvable under the following rules:

Each character is decoded as one digit (0 - 9).
Every pair of different characters they must map to different digits.
Each words[i] and result are decoded as one number without leading zeros.
Sum of numbers on left side (words) will equal to the number on right side (target). 

Return True if the equation is solvable otherwise return False.

Input Description:
First line contains, N the total number of words.(1<N<100)
Second line contains, N words in a row.
Third line contains, target string as input.

Output Description:
Print True or False.

Sample Input:
2
send more
money

Sample Output:
True

Explanation:
'S'-> 9, 'E'->5, 'N'->6, 'D'->7, 'M'->1, 'O'->0, 'R'->8, 'Y'->'2'
Such that: "SEND" + "MORE" = "MONEY" ,  9567 + 1085 = 10652.
So the output is True.
